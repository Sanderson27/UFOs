# Overview
 
 Through creation of a website using html we are able to better show our data. Particularly being able to addd filters allows the user to find specific data quickly. Now they are able to look up sightings based on a specific place, time or both.
 
 ## Results
  
  A user is able to simply put the year they wish to look up to see data about all sightings during that time. Thwy are then able to drop down much further as that would still show a lot of data. A user may want to filter date location or even the shape of the UFO all at once to find specific data.
  
 ## Summary 
  
  We can continue to change and upgrade this site. Suggested imporvements would be parse the data itself in more ways such that a user could see Just the shapes for example of all data pulled from a specific area. I think the color format could use a bit of brightening, on my machine I find it hard to read.
